- To start developing with EVA 2.0, start by creating a virtual environment to build all the necessary dependencies
`python -m venv ./venv`
- This will create a virtual environment named venv
- Activate your venv and install requirements -> pip install -r requirements.txt
- There will most likely be issues, if they're not documented here message me (peter14mail@gmail.om)
